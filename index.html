         <p>Information technology fosters innovation in business. Innovation results in smarter apps, improved data storage, faster processing, and wider information distribution. Innovation makes businesses run more efficiently. And innovation increases value, enhances quality, and boosts productivity.

         <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
         <p>Every successful project, especially using potentially complex and expensive aspects such as IT, needs to be properly planned and resourced. It is no good getting ready to deliver something to a customer and then discovering that a widget that makes it all work in the learner's environment is missing in the clients. Equally, it is good to set out some sort of method before you begin. You don’t always need to be linear and follow a set route. In some cases, this may not be effective. The method might require you to downgrade a project. Often called the project 'terms of reference', the project specification should be an accurate description of what the plan aims to achieve, and the criteria and flexibility involved, its parameters, scope, range, outputs, sources, participants, budgets and timescales (beware - see note below about planning timescales). Typically and prior to the project's formal establishment the scheme 'terms of reference' are produced or at least drafted at a fundamental level by a 'project sponsor', or 'executive in charge' (of the project). Before carrying out the project, one should understand the concise information needed and the relevant tools involved such as the precise software, templates, hardware, financial support, people involved, and compare with the ability to implement. Tools such as Trello, GDPR, AICPA SOC, HIPPA and just to name a few, are software will help in effective planning, boost efficiency, improve visibility to gain and maintain control, consolidate and hold data in one place for easy and proper evaluation. These software explain and guide anyone from planning stage, monitoring, to completion and testing with ease. Ref:

Saying “Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure. Most of these factors share one common root cause: the inadequate understanding of business processes. The lack of Business Process Transformation insight when it comes to large digital and IT projects creates inefficiencies, unintended consequences, and can often inhibit the adoption of new digital products.

         <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
         <p>Despite the best intentions and ever-evolving methodologies, at the end of the day many digital/IT projects still are not successful. Several different studies over the past five years put the industry success rate below 60%. Misalignment with business processes: Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail. This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology. Aligning digital and business goals and integrating new products seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success. Lack of cross-functional expertise: Similar to number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes. Limited digital strategy. Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward. Fixed plans that don’t account for change: The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment. Overambition: Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. Saying “Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure. Most of these factors share one common root cause: the inadequate understanding of business processes. The lack of Business Process Transformation insight when it comes to large digital and IT projects creates inefficiencies, unintended consequences, and can often inhibit the adoption of new digital products.

         <h2>1.5 Describing how I went about selecting and using IT systems and software, and how I selected the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
            <br>
         <p>Technology is supposed to make life easier: increasing productivity, helping to keep any business organized, and giving it the competitive edge. I delved deeply into searching for efficiency. After having been introduced to Python coding, HTML writing, VSC presentation, CSS styling, One-Drive storage system and Trello consolidation and presentation methods, I was able to pull this through knowing that they all came from the best coding institute. That singular decision was made because of Code Nation’s presentation of these systems and software.</p>

         <h2>1.6 To describe and provide analysis on how my chosen technologies have helped me</h2>
         <p>The importance of my chosen technologies cannot be overemphasized because it is obvious that the end product justifies it all.</p>
         <p>To digress a little, python gave me the codes to display and defined the objective of the project. Somewhere along the line, Visual Studio Code, HTML and CSS surfaced  to continue with the manipulations and of  the codes. Trello  and One Drive took it a step forward by arranging , assembling the content during which One Drive did not manifest any threat to storing the project.</p>

         <h2>1.7 To describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
         <p>GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation. This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.
         <p>What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe. According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address. There is no distinction between personal data about individuals in their private, public or work roles – the person is the person. Also in a B2B setting, everything is about individuals interacting and sharing information with and about each other. Customers in B2B market are obviously companies, but the relationships that handle the business topics are people – or individuals.

         <p>The 8 basic rights of GDPR Under the GDPR, individuals have: The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested. 
            The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted. 
            The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format. The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered.
            Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied. The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect. 
            The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. </p>
            Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
            <br>
            The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
            The right to be notified – If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach. The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain.</p>
            <br>
         <p>The implications of GDPR and how this new data protection regulation puts the consumer in the driver’s seat, and the task of complying with this regulation falls upon IT businesses and organizations is a complete obstacle to IT. Since almost all businesses are using IT systems, one must map their company’s data map where all of the personal data in your entire business comes from and document what you do with the data.
            Identify where the data resides, who can access it and if there are any risks to the data. This is not only important for GDPR, but will help improve Customer Relationship Management. Determine what data you need to keep
             <br>                   
            <p>Don’t keep more information than necessary and remove any data that you aren’t using. If my business has collected a lot of data without any real benefit, now is the time to consider which data is important to your business. 
            GDPR encourages a more disciplined treatment of personal data. In the clean-up process, ask yourself: Why exactly are we archiving this data instead of just erasing it? Why are we saving all this data? 
            What are we trying to achieve by collecting all these categories of personal information? Is the financial gain of deleting this information greater than encrypting it? Put security measures in place 
            Develop and implement safeguards throughout your infrastructure to help contain any data breaches.</p> 
            <br>
         <p>This means putting security measures in place to guard against data breaches, and taking quick action to notify individuals and authorities in the event a breach does occur. 
            Worryingly, law firm EMW found that data breach complaints have increased by 160% since the GDPR came into effect. Make sure to check with your suppliers also. Outsourcing doesn’t exempt you from being liable and you need to make sure that they have the right security measures in place. 
            For example, the recent data breach for companies using third party survey provider, Type-form. Type form are quick to communicate the data breach and included a template for their customers that used their software to collect personal information (as shown below). Review your documentation Under GDPR, individuals have to explicitly consent to the acquisition and processing of their data. Pre-checked boxes and implied consent will not be acceptable anymore. You will have to review all of your privacy statements and disclosures and adjust them where needed.
            Establish procedures for handling personal data As I mentioned earlier, individuals have 8 basic rights under GDPR. IT systems now need to establish policies and procedures on how to handle each of these situations. How can individuals give consent in a legal manner? 
            What is the process if an individual wants his data to be deleted? How will you ensure that it is done across all platforms and that it really is deleted? If an individual wants his data to be transferred, how will you do it? How will you confirm that the person who requested to have his data transferred is the person he says he is? What is the communication plan in case of a data breach?</p>

         <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h2>

         <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
            
         <p>I love Visual Studio Code because it combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging. First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas</h2>
         <p>Trello is even extraordinarily fantastic to use. It enabled me to arrange my facts under “to-do” list and later on progressed to the “Doing” segment and finally the  ”Done” section where the work is admirably simple and time is well managed. It offers the opportunity to play with your content at all times because the instructions are simple to follow.</p>
         <p>Minimizing confusion around project assignments with simple tools to organize tasks and track progress. Customizable lists that allow users to follow</p>
         <p>Successful business process improvement initiatives start with business value. Organizations must understand their business goals and strategy, then analyze their current processes to identify those that will deliver the greatest return on investment.</p>

      <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,
            Trello</h2>
            <p>
I found Trello and Visual Studio Code appropriate. As stated in the last point, I like the simplicity of using VSCode. I used it for HTML and CSS and it allowed me to edit my code easily and at the same time. I think Trello was appropriate because it lets me lay out my work from start to finish and use templates to plan my website. Next time I would utilise Trello more to plan even better than I did for this coursework.
            </p>

<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
      your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the
      interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
      <p>
Yes, I am happy with the website. Unfortunately I lost some of my work near the deadline, which was frustrating but I was able to recreate my work, and I will take this as good experience for next time. If I had more time, I would have added more style and design, but due to the time constraits I kept it simple and within the brief of what was expected, so overall I'm happy with it.
<br>
I chose the colour scheme of blue and light green which is nice to look and makes the text easy to read. I also used eye-catching images that reflect the project well.
      </p>
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

<p>
   As I said, I would spend more time styling the website. With my limited knowledge, I can only do so much, so I would study CSS more and practice to be more confident to implement more styling on my website. As mentioned, I would also use Trello more next time to make sure I am planning well.
</p>

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>
<p>
I have checked the assignment briefs to make sure that my coursework meets all requirements needed. This includes making sure all the coursework content is there, that the CSS styling is working, there aren't any bugs such as broken images or dead links. I did this in reference to a point in Unit 2 of the assignment brief: 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.
</p>


         <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems</h2>
         
         <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
            productivity and efciency – could you have been more efcient when making your
            website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
         <p>Business process management and process improvement can seem challenging in the face of complex, interdependent and dynamic business processes, but the right approach can get you there.</p>         
        
         <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency</h2>
         <p>It is important to understand your objectives.</p>
         <p>To increase productivity and efficiency, invest in new equipment that will make you more successful in the marketplace</p>
         <p>This will help you stay ahead of your competitors in perfomance
            Can you upgrade instead of buying new equipment and still get better performance</p>
         <p>Avoid being influenced by aggressive marketing campaigns that make unrealistic claims.</p>

         <p>Get an external point of view which will depend on the scale of your investment, it may be worth working with an external consultant who can ensure you make the most of your purchase by helping you assess your needs.
            Initially, you'll be looking at important factors such as capacity, employee usage and current resources. The most common practice is to do a cost-benefit analysis, which helps you justify your purchase and determine the pros and cons.
         <p>Measure your ability to get optimal results from equipment and other assets. 
            The premise is that more efficient equipment will give you better results.</be>p>
         <p>Predictive maintenance to prevent costly repairs and unplanned downtime
            higher automation to save labour costs and improve throughput. The use of 3-D printers to achieve faster prototyping, reducing the cost of engineering and accelerating time to market
            Meanwhile, improved quality comes from technologies such as real-time quality controls</p> 
            <br>
         <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
         <p>To use the daily help at hand: ask for unlimited telephone support; unlimited email support; unlimited remote support; support for printers, scanners, routers and networking equipment
            Ongoing help: 24-hour system monitoring; server management and maintenance; computer maintenance; backup management and monitoring
            Your long-term IT health: annual review of systems, including personalised system security and vulnerability audit, business continuity policy and disaster recovery policy; and warranty management</p>
         <p>I will engage team work using slack that can accept different files and uploaods for easy communication. this will go a long way in solving IT problems and the exchange of new ideas</p>
         
         <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
         <p>Digital testing engulfs a lot of expertise, thus all new software or hardware comes with testing instructions which needs adhering to.</p>
         <p>The most important fact is to consult the supporting services, engineers/help desk for any malfunctioning
         
         <h2>Unit 2: Website Software</h2>
         
      




            <h2>Unit 2 Outcome 1</p>
               <p>Create structures and styles for a webpage You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work. It’s time for you to create a website that details you, and including pages/sections and a how you built it page: Website name; plan out a hierarchy before developing website. Create a URL structure create site navigation in HTML or CSS... - Title - Body - Div.</h2>
      
               <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>

               <p>Copyright protections cover original works of authorship, including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works. Copyrighted work must be original, and it must be fixed into a "tangible form." Ideas themselves can't be copyrighted</p>
               <p>Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish. The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.</p>

               <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
               <p>Common disabilities include physical deformities that affect the upper and lower limbs, manual dexterity problems, inability to coordinate body organs and others. The cause of the disability may be due to old age, a viral infection such as polio, a hereditary condition and paralysis or amputation. Designing Websites For Mobility or Physically Impaired People People with mobility disabilities have physical impairments that substantially limit movement and fine motor controls, such as lifting, walking, and typing. Mobility impaired individuals experience difficulties in using the computer’s input devices and in handling storage media. Solutions for persons with mobility disabilities include switches, latches, and controls that are easy to manipulate, and diskettes and media that are easy to insert and remove. Additional solutions include alternate input capabilities, such as voice input or the ability to enter information at the user’s own pace. For example, sequences of keystrokes can be typed, one at a time, rather than simultaneously as in Ctrl+Alt+Del. Many of these needs are supported by assistive technology, operating systems, and hardware platforms. Furthermore, making the Web site accessible will make it more compatible with voice input and control technologies. Things To Remember For people who have difficulty using their hands or whose hand/eye co-ordination is restricted, the following guidelines can improve access. Provision of buttons rather than text for navigation to provide a larger ‘target’ for links. Having said that – if you design your web pages so that the text can be resized easily there should be no need to use graphics so that you can provide a larger target. Clear consistent layouts and navigation. Don’t think everybody uses a mouse Remember to consider the physical access to the computer itself. If a website is being designed for use in a public kiosk, the kiosk should be accessible to wheelchair users. How To Design A Website For People With Learning Disabilities
                  There are of course marked differences in cognitive skills between individuals with learning difficulties and it would be virtually impossible to design a website to meet all requirements – however here are some general rules worth applying when creating websites for this demographic. Design simple uniform screen layouts (with the option of only viewing one thing at a time), keep jargon to a minimum and use plain language and avoid pages overloaded with too many distractions (like flashing graphics) or too many choices (like a large cumbersome navigation system). For the same reason avoid long lists of links unless they are arranged in logical groups of no more than five or six links each. The combination of auditory information, pictures, and text helps to reinforce navigation and actions for those who have a short attention span or are easily distracted. This will also be useful for those who cannot read (over 80 per cent) or are surfing the web with assistance. Auditory information should be clear, simple and repeatable. Other suggestions include: Provide a plain language description of the site Include a simple way and obvious way to return to your home page Avoid animated graphics – if they change too quickly their use can lead to cognitive overload Simplify sequences – limit choice and number of steps How to Design A Site For People With Dyslexia
               </p>
               <p>Designing a site for visitors with Dyslexia starts with asking ‘What Problems Would a Dyslexic User Face?‘ 
               <p>People with dyslexia frequently experience discomfort when reading because they find it more difficult to “decode” the words on the page, and can also find it difficult to remain focussed on a particular piece of text. Some people may also have to concentrate more to remember what they have already read, which means they will tire more easily. Web designers, developers and copywriters should keep these 17 tips in mind: Text size – the minimum recommended font size for users with dyslexia is 12pt. Printed material should always be made available at this size. Text scaling – on a website you may wish to use a default size smaller than 12pt. If so, use a font size which scales easily, such as percent (%) or em. This way users with dyslexia (or poorer vision) can adjust their own settings to increase the font size. Note that if you start with a base font size of around 80% (used by a lot of websites), Internet Explorer will allow a font size increase to over 12pt at the largest setting, but at 70%, a user with Internet Explorer will not be able to reach a font size of 12pt. Font style – use a rounded font that is easy on the eye. Use a sans-serif style font (i.e. without curly bits). Commonly used fonts for this purpose are Arial, Comic Sans, Verdana, Helvetica, Tahoma and Trebuchet. It is important to note that not every dyslexic user dislikes serif fonts: many have no problem with them provided the line spacing is sufficient. Capitalisation – avoid the use of capitalisation for emphasis. All capitals can make text more difficult to read and gives the impression of shouting. Background – an off-white background can be easier to read from than a shiny white background. Text is also harder to read on a patterned or tiled background. Spacing – use line spacing between paragraphs to break up text. Justification – don’t right justify text. This leads to variable spacing between words and can create visual patterns of white space which are difficult to ignore and are sometimes termed rivers of white, running down the page making it extremely difficult to read. Italics – avoid them. They make text more difficult to read. Paragraphs – keep them short.
                  Use lists to bullet point items rather than presenting continuous prose. Number menu items where appropriate. Writing style – use short words where possible, and write in simple sentences. Refer to the reader as you. Navigation – ensure your navigation is simple and stays the same across the site. It is helpful to include a site map and a search facility. Moving text – this creates problems for dyslexic users and users with other visual impairments. Don’t use it. Columns – Dyslexic people find that the further text is presented from one side of the screen to the other, the more difficult it becomes to read. Ideally a column should be no more than 70-80 characters wide. Pictures – where a picture will aid comprehension, use one. Document structure – as a general rule, the more structured your document is, the easier it will be to understand. Use headings, bulleted lists, numbered lists and indented quotes where appropriate. Abbreviations – always expand the first occurrence of any abbreviation on a page. For subsequent occurrences, consider use of and elements to aid understanding.</p>

               <p>The above 17 tips was provided by JackP – (and titled designing for Dyslexia.) of The Pickards who kindly allowed me (Shaun Anderson) to republish it here on my website, many years ago now.) Is Your Website Legal? Does It Comply With UK Laws on Disability? Have you ever asked yourself the question: “Is my website design legal under current UK Law? You might not know this, but it HAS to be.
               <p>The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 – The DDA and the secondary legislation applied within Northern Ireland have placed a legal duty on service providers to make reasonable adjustments to the way they provide services to ensure that disabled people can use them. The DDA states that disabled people should not be treated less favourably than other people when accessing services. This duty extends to the provision of websites where a website falls within the definition of a service under the terms of the DDA. It is not possible to provide a definitive specification for a fully accessible website which will satisfy the requirements of the DDA, however the guidance set out in PAS 78 represents what the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) believes to be good practice website design.</p>
               <p>What Are My Obligations Under The UK DDA? Broadly speaking, the UK DDA makes it unlawful to discriminate against disabled people in the way in which you recruit and employ people; provide services; or provide education. Discrimination can take place in two ways – by treating a disabled person less favourably; and/or by failing to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ so that disabled people can participate in employment and education or make use of a service. How Does The UK DDA Apply To Websites? Websites may be covered under the employment provisions, as they may be a means of advertising jobs; or there may be an intranet which staff need to use. Websites will most commonly be covered when they constitute the provision of a service, or they are related to education (See SENDA). The UK Disability Discrimination Act.</p>
               <p>Excerpts from the UK Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and related guidelines relevant to the legal compliance of websites.</p> 
               <p>Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995, Section III 19. – (1) It is unlawful for a provider of services to discriminate against a disabled person- (a) in refusing to provide, or deliberately not providing, to the disabled person any service which he provides, or is prepared to provide, to members of the public; (b) in failing to comply with any duty imposed on him by section 21 in circumstances in which the effect of that failure is to make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for the disabled person to make use of any such service; (c) in the standard of service which he provides to the disabled person or the manner in which he provides it to him; or (d) in the terms on which he provides a service to the disabled person. Code of Practice (revised) – Rights of Access Goods, Facilities, Services and premises:
                  2.17 – It is important to remember that it is the provision of the service which is affected by Part III of the Act and not the nature of the service or business or the type of establishment from which it is provided. In many cases a service provider is providing a service by a number of different means. In some cases, however, each of those means of service might be regarded as a service in itself and subject to the Act. [Example]: An airline company provides a flight reservation and booking service to the public on its website. This is a provision of a service and is subject to the Act.
